0,Manpreet Singh,3,"I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times!

8,SK,5,"Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get.Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money.Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision.

10,Prasad G.,5,"I have been using One Plus 8, 6GB RAM, 128 GB version for past two days. I bought this phone at 39,999(2K discount with SBI CC). I was bit skeptcial before i bought this phone as i was planning to buy the PRO version, but i do not regret anymore :)This is my first encounter with luxury segment and believe me it's amazing.Truly iconic experience. It's a master piece in terms of performance. works at lightning speed, face detection is utterly smooth, finger print sensor on the screen works like a charm.Very smooth display(90 hz). You will see a notable difference from 60 Hz phones available out in the market.Built in Alexa capability, ofcourse you have to install the app from Play store.Camera is really good when the object is closer and detail is lost to some extent for distant objects. It could have been better at this price segment, but then no complaints.Final verdict: Just close your eyes and buy it if you are looking for a ultra smooth experience and nice looking smartphone and you may not be fully satisfied if you are looking for a Camera phone matching with Apple standards.","I have been using One Plus 8, 6GB RAM, 128 GB version for past two days.

12,Vikas Shah,5,"I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5.1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing.2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging.3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth.4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing.5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins.6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear.7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good.Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple.I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days.

It seems like one plus launched half cooked phone.,Front camera is really bad with the latest update. It takes blurry photos and night performance is also bad.

15,Amazon Customer,1,Display which takes the major chunk of ur attention is awful. At low brightnes settings flickering of white texts are visible... In low brightness videos that are shot in dark situations are just invisible. Was watching Expanse in my oneplus 6t before switching to 8. Basically in low brightnes the series is unwatchable in the 8. Every other issue like average camera I can live with. Unlesss oneplus pushes some update before my return time expires I am returning this junk.,Display which takes the major chunk of ur attention is awful.

29,musa kharbe,5,"Some people are comparing Oneplus 8  with Onplus Nord. In case you are confuse and you have the budget please go for this one for following reasons:1.Oneplus nord has cheap plastic frame. This one has aluminum. Build quality is superb and premium.2. Nord has 8mp wide angle camera this one has 16mp which rocks3. Nord doesn't have stereo speakers. The speaker on plus 8 are stereos with dolby support.4. Nord has UFS 2.1 vs Oneplus has UFS 3.05. Nord has ugly dual camera holes in front compared to oneplus 8 having single punch hole6. The most significant difference is a flagship processor. Nothing can beat snapdragon 865. Nord has mid range processor. This one is a beast7. Although the resolution and refresh rate is same. Nord has a low quality display while  oneplus has used samsung Amoled panel with eye care certification in oneplus 8.8. Curved display is premium feature which looks good you don't get that in Nord. It make phone easy to hold as well9. Oneplus 8 supports usb type C3.0 vs nord has slower type C 2.010. Although both Nord and oneplus 8 are not officially waterproof, oneplus 8 is actually some waterproof without certification.11. Nord is not future proof due to performance this one can last you atleast 3 year Snapdragon 865 is not a joke","Some people are comparing Oneplus 8  with Onplus Nord.

55,MS,3,"This review is based solely on comparisons with my previous phone the Galaxy S8.Having used S8, this phone feels sort of a step down or more appropriately just a continuation of the features on S8. Given that the S8 was released more than 3 years back, there is no significant advantage of this phone mainly when it comes to software. Or probably it's just my opinion after getting used to the myriad of software tweaks and options that Samsung provided.Even with a 6gb ram, and with only 3-4 apps running in bg, lots of the apps like chrome, prime video, youtube etc still freeze up sometimes and you have to close and re-open the app. This is something I never faced on my other phones before. This proves the OS is not very good at memory management.This has triple camera, but the macro camera is just a waste of space added solely so that One plus can claim they offer a triple camera setup. The camera feels severely limited in the software field.Design is quite good but again it's nothing that I have not experienced before. The 2mp camera reminds me of my sony erricsson k series phones which was like 10 years back.Weird flickering when scrolling through dark themed pages mostly with night mode on.Speaking of night mode, it is an absolute joke. If it has been applied, when you turn on the display, brightness is normal without any night mode filter which will initially hurt your eyes in the dark(if it's not dark can't see why anyone would use night mode), then gradually the filter would start to apply over the screen. Now some one plus fans find this gradual application cool, but honestly it will just hurt your eyes with the initial high level of brightness in a dark room.Speed is awesome with the new Snapdragon processor and 90hz screen refresh rate.(if you ignore the application freeze issue)Battery Life is okay.Phone just doesn't feel as smooth as even older samsung s series or iphone. It just leaves a lot to be desired on the software front particularly if you are stepping down from an Apple or a Samsung flagship.If you have the budget, then go for some other flagship or the 8 pro if, hopefully, it does not have the same performance glitches.","This review is based solely on comparisons with my previous phone the Galaxy S8.Having used S8, this phone feels sort of a step down or more appropriately just a continuation of the features on S8.

58,Sagnik Sarkar,5,"I have been using this device for more than a month now. First let's talk about the Pros.Pros:1. Oxygen OS - If you're an exisiting OnePlus user then you'll be quite familiar with the user friendly and bloatware free experience Oxygen OS has to offer. If not you're in for a treat.2. Screen quality - This phone has one of the best display to offer in this price segment. Yes some people might not like the curve but take my word for it 4k/FHD videos will take you to another viewing level experience when it comes to OnePlus 8's Fluid Amoled display.3. Battery life - I am a heavy user but still the phone provides me with a full day battery support if I keep it on overnight charging and start the day with 100% battery in my bank. You'll find it very hard to drain this phone's battery to 0 even with heavy usage.5. Performance - Now coming to the big boy's playground. This phone will provide you with a blazing fast and snappy experience in day to day use. High end games,multiple apps open in the background,video rendering you throw anything and everything to it and it will pass with flying colours. The RAM management is also pretty well optimized.6. Build quaity - The in hand experience is something I liked a lot. You'll feel that you're holding a premium smartphone in your hand. It fits perfectly in your palm and you'll be able to use it even with one hand.Cons:1. Camera - The only con I can think of is the camera and that's only because of the infamous 2MP macro camera. It's a gimmick. But tbh the camera performance of this device is no less than a flagship if you consider the primary camera and the wide angle lens. The image processing has been done brilliantly and after a couple of software updates the pictures started turning out brilliant. Good dynamic range and colour reproduction. Since it has OIS videos are not shaky at all. If OnePlus is able to produce good quality images with the 2MP macro lens with some software update then it would be the icing on the cake.Final verdict:OnePlus 8 is an excellent smartphone and if you're looking for that flagship experience and you don't want to spend those extra bucks for IP rating,Wireless charging and a Telephoto lens then ditch it's big brother and go for the OnePlus 8. You won't be disappointed.","I have been using this device for more than a month now. First let's talk about the Pros.Pros:1.

This phone will provide you with a blazing fast and snappy experience in day to day use. High end games,multiple apps open in the background,video rendering you throw anything and everything to it and it will pass with flying colours. The RAM management is also pretty well optimized.6. Build quaity - The in hand experience is something I liked a lot. You'll feel that you're holding a premium smartphone in your hand. It fits perfectly in your palm and you'll be able to use it even with one hand.Cons:1. Camera - The only con I can think of is the camera and that's only because of the infamous 2MP macro camera. It's a gimmick. But tbh the camera performance of this device is no less than a flagship if you consider the primary camera and the wide angle lens. The image processing has been done brilliantly and after a couple of software updates the pictures started turning out brilliant. Good dynamic range and colour reproduction. Since it has OIS videos are not shaky at all. If OnePlus is able to produce good quality images with the 2MP macro lens with some software update then it would be the icing on the cake.Final verdict:OnePlus 8 is an excellent smartphone and if you're looking for that flagship experience and you don't want to spend those extra bucks for IP rating,Wireless charging and a Telephoto lens then ditch it's big brother and go for the OnePlus 8. You won't be disappointed."
59,Shahidkhan pathan,4,"So starting from design and talking about some cons and pros of this beast.The design is very stunning and brilliant than more premium phones,the battery backup is very much of good and as I am a pubg player I use to play 4 hrs continuously without any lag,heating issue & battery drain issue i.e battery backup is pretty worth.Comes to processor it is most speedy device I have ever seen previously I was using on of oneplus flagship device and also tried asus rog 2 but this is much more faster.Lastly comes to camera if u are camera holic don't even think to buy this phone my friend has nokia which worth rs 9k and I found camera quality of that phone is much better in comparison to this device horrible camera quality nightscape pictures look blurry and ultra wide angle is just like zoomout option and selfie looks like cheaper version of vivo another disadvantage is brightness you have to make your brightness full in normal daylight and night mode or reading mode is not that powerful as previous phone.","So starting from design and talking about some cons and pros of this beast.The design is very stunning and brilliant than more premium phones,the battery backup is very much of good and as I am a pubg player I use to play 4 hrs continuously without any lag,heating issue & battery drain issue i.e battery backup is pretty worth.Comes to processor it is most speedy device I have ever seen previously I was using on of oneplus flagship device and also tried asus rog 2 but this is much more faster.Lastly comes to camera if u are camera holic don't even think to buy this phone my friend has nokia which worth rs 9k and I found camera quality of that phone is much better in comparison to this device horrible camera quality nightscape pictures look blurry and ultra wide angle is just like zoomout option and selfie looks like cheaper version of vivo another disadvantage is brightness you have to make your brightness full in normal daylight and night mode or reading mode is not that powerful as previous phone."
60,HARSH S.,2,I ordered OnePlus 8 (6GB +128GB) variant and recieved it with a slight scratch on the back camera and had to return it.OnePlus shouldn't call their devices flagship unless they aren't able to ensure the 'QUALITY' of the product.Also the so called very good battery was draining very fast.,I ordered OnePlus 8 (6GB +128GB) variant and recieved it with a slight scratch on the back camera and had to return it.OnePlus shouldn't call their devices flagship unless they aren't able to ensure the 'QUALITY' of the product.Also the so called very good battery was draining very fast.

62,Joe Thomas,4,"I was using one plus 5t since 2018. No issues till date. So I decided to upgrade to one plus 8. Before purchase I heard a lot of negative reviews from youtube and Amazon customer feedbacks. But I didn't backward, I trust one plus. And I purchased one plus 8 on 7th Aug and got in hands on 10 th Aug as they promised. I got this for 37k on Amazon Prime Day deal and MFD of phone is 06 2020.I checked everything. The camera, screen quantity, heating issue etc. Based on that I am reviewing the phone. Every thing is good except camera. Iam not saying the camera is bad but The camera could be better. Hoping one plus will solve the issue on next software update.One more thing I have to share that there is having heating issue while playing pubg for more than 1 hour in 90hrz. I am not a pubg player. I have to test the phone. That's why I played pubg. If you are not a pubg player you will love this phone. Iam sure one plus will improve this phone with software update. If you have budget for 41k phone I suggest this one is worth.","I was using one plus 5t since 2018. No issues till date. So I decided to upgrade to one plus 8.

At a price range of 39000/- to 40000/- this is a best bet as there is no other competition to the one plus 8 in market at present.2. Asthetic built quality, very nice in hand feel which can be easily noticed while holding the unit in hand. This is a practical size 6.55‚Äù screen which can fit in the pockets of trousers or jeans. Light weight (180 gms) and ergonomic design make it user friendly and comfortable to hold. Weight balance is excellent and feels premium in hands.3. Glacial green colour to me is the best bet. Looks premium, anti-finger print.4. Curved screen is not that much and i am not facing any accidental touch issues rather the curved screen adds to its premiumness.5.

66,Manish Anand,5,"I remember I was one of the early buyers, bought the phone on the first day of sell. Writing the review after using a month, I would say screen quality and battery life are superb. For camera I would give 4/5. Although we don't get wireless charging with it but with 30w warp charger the phone gets charged in no time. SD 865 will not give you a chance to complain about the performance. Premium design,feels smooth, bit slippery if you don't use any cover. The phone comes with 5G, we are not talking about 5G in India now but you never know in a year or so. Overall experience has been excellent.","I remember I was one of the early buyers, bought the phone on the first day of sell.

71,Amazon Customer,5,Well after using one plus 8 6GB variant for 20 days i am writing this review. In a crisp and short version...it is great phone if you are looking for a sleek sexy Device with flagship processor and clean OS. Updates are on time already had 2 updates by now.Primary camera is great and deapth is also great. They tske very clear shots even in lowlight. Nightscape works well but with flash also it takes perfect shots. Macro is nice but only in day light or good lighting condition.If you are Camera geek then also it is a nice phone for you except rhe Macro part...telephoto he de dete to acha hota.Day to day usage ram management is great.Battery life is more than 24 Hours if you are medium usage person. And upto 14-16 hours if you play a lot of PUBG on it. I have already accidentally dropped it and not a single scratch or damage to body.In short loving this phone for all the great package at a good price.,Well after using one plus 8 6GB variant for 20 days i am writing this review.

79,Neoharys,4,"The phone is definitely great. The battery life is amazing and feels amazing in your hands. It is kinda narrower, I prefer thick wide displays though didn't faced any issues. The first thing I noticed is that phone heats up, after updating and downloading essential services the heat up issues were resolved. The camera quality is really good too, I have seen many reviewers trash them for the price (in Indian varients it's definitely worth the money). The phone is assembled in India which does gives Indian economy a slight boast, but if you can afford a better phone from samsung go for it. The telephoto being absent doesn't even makes any difference, the 2X digital zoom is just as good. The Macro lens is weird and has a circular blur around it, but is usable. The updates will make phone better I'm sure of it. This was my first premium phone after a 5 year old budget one.I'm sharing the camera samples, please don't mind the background.

83,sahith v.,3,Performance wise it's a beast. Disappointed with camera.Micro camera is utter waste . Portrait also fades the image quality.Indoor photo quality is not great. I personally don't get the flagship feel although flagship features are present. Pubg is very smooth . Battery is okay.Should have provided other colours for 6gb version bcz some of them won't like green. Case provided is absolutely waste. Becomes yellow in 2 days . Call quality is best and microphone performs very good. Brightness is eye catchy but becomes difficult at night.,Performance wise it's a beast. Disappointed with camera.Micro camera is utter waste .

Security is not like other Chinese brands so you can trust OnePlus. I only have complain about the camera only but I guess it can be better through a software update. Overall very good product and beleive me you will love to use it and I am happy with the purchase. Keep it up OnePlus.","Over all good product but some time the product disappoints me while using camera, the portrait mode doesn't perform very well battery life is not too good or not too bad it's okay for a normal user, you will get 7-8hrs screen on time and the best part of the mobile is it is slim and can use single handed easily.

86,Srinjan saha,5,"The device with the best performance. Absolutely in love with the magic of oxygen OS. Camera is not the best, but not bad either(suffers in low light). Display is sharp, bright enough, and 90hz is the champ factor. No display issues like green tint, black bar. Battery backup is the best thing about this phone, consistently getting 7+ hours of SOT on 90hz. Definitely worth the money and better option than the Oneplus 8 pro, as neither of them have flagship grade cameras (still a long way to go for Op in camera dept).In depth camera review - Selfie 8.5/10, main camera 8/10 , ultrawide 8/10, macro 3/10 , night mode 7/10 , colors 9/10, dynamic range 9.5/10, sharpness 8/10, details 10/10, exposure 7/10.Overall experience of using the phone - 9.5/10I'm happy that I switched from my S9 plus to this device, as performance is what matters to me and the majority of the users. Exquisite cameras are just luxuries which is only there on iPhones, Samsung devices.","The device with the best performance. Absolutely in love with the magic of oxygen OS.

89,Venkata Harish Tallam,5,"Have been waiting for the OP8 and finally got it into my hands. And this is my first One plus phone.Pros:1. The first plus point is its Oxygen OS. Before this mobile I was using Stock Android based mobile. I'm really happy with the OS.2. Charging is super fast with 30 watt charger. 100% charging in less than 50 mins3. The screen touch with 90hz is like a velvet feel4. Camera is good, but not the best. But, this will fulfill most of camera usage.Cons:1. Missing Telephoto lens for this budget.2. OP8 can be made more budget friendly by launching only 4G supportive device. This will eventually reduce the cost of the phone.","Have been waiting for the OP8 and finally got it into my hands.

90,Pooja,4,"The phone lives upto its hype. It's fast and snappy performance with 90hz display is the best.Battery is decent and with heavy usage I get one days worth.The only lacking thing in this phone is the camera and if you do want a good camera phone go for the Samsung s10 lite. Other than that i have had no issues. It would have been better if they had given a headphone jack, but nonetheless this was a compromise I was ready to make.P.S: Download Gcam for a better camera experience. The first picture is taken from Gcam and the second from stock camera.","The phone lives upto its hype.

But night photography is not hit the level that I expected from this device.- Video performance is nothing to say, it's predominant!!!- Fast charging as well.- I face only one problem from this device that, it's ram boost function in settings is not worked well. Sometimes especially when I using whatsapp, the application is automatically closed during typings. It's may be due to enabling the function ""Ram boost "" in settings. May be they will solved it by next updates.-90Hz is awesome, but it's drain battery very fastly.

98,Amazon Customer,2,"Being a one plus fan, I was very much excited about this device. The performance of the device is no doubt a beast but the device is facing a serious display issue.When the brightness is set to very low on the display the complete shadow of the fingerprint sensor is visible. I have attached the photos for reference. When you pay such a premium for a device you do not expect such a poor quality display. I think Oneplus should address this issue and come with a proper answer.Apart from display issue the phone is tremendous in each and every aspect though the camera might be a hit or a miss.I had to replace my device once and then opt for a refund as this issue was something way big for me. The display is something you directly interact with and if it is faulty then your complete experience is ruined.So in my opinion it will be more of a lottery like feeling if you can get a perfectly good phone.At last, dividing my review in pros and cons:PROS:-1) Great gaming and day to day performance.2) The dolby atmos enabled speaker is a joy to listen.3) The battery can easily last the whole day at 90 hz ( over 6 hrs of sot)4) The phone feels very premium and sturdy in hand.CONS:-1) Display issue as mentioned earlier.2) The camera could had been better, specially the front camera.

108,Tanmoy Modak,5,"The phone feels great in hand, premium and stylish, the glacial green is not totally green and the matte AG finish gives good reflections of light make the phone look more premium. The screen is awesome, the one thing is it doesn't have a e.tmm jack so you have to get a converter and need more updates on bug fixes for the apps. Battery is good still could be more optimised, overall bang for the buck! Can go for it.","The phone feels great in hand, premium and stylish, the glacial green is not totally green and the matte AG finish gives good reflections of light make the phone look more premium.

110,Mallika R.,5,"Here are some observations that I've noticed:CONS:1) The fingerprint scanner is not very efficient. It sometimes gives trouble scanning my finger.2) Surprisingly, the battery life of my phone couldn't last for 7 hrs of minimum usage which was disappointing.3) The camera is definitely an improvement over its predecessors but it still does not compete with some of the  higher end brands.PROS1) The Warp charger charged my phone in 1 hr from 9% to 100% which is pretty good.2) The 90hz refresh rate is just stunning! A very noticeable difference from 60-90.3) Stunning visuals, speakers and a well built body. It has a very premium feel attached to it.4) No lag in games. Quite a few games such as PUBG runs at 90 fps which is just marvelous.5) Barely any heating of the device as well.Overall, great phone.

Major issue is with the display, for which both saturation and contrast levels are poorly calibrated. Whites are super white and darks are pitch black, and color reproduction is way off the mark. Camera is the biggest disappointment. A 20k phone captures better photos than this. Also there is some issue when videos are viewed at 420p in YouTube. The clarity and sharpness of video at 420p looks like 240p in other phones.

1169,Amazon Customer,1,"When I connect the 'OnePlus Type-C to 3.5mm adapter' to use my Headphone, the Phone does not always recognise it - not unless I reboot the Phone. No matter what the state of the Phone is, the Type-C Port should truly remain plug-and-play. The Phone may be a state-of-the-art device - but, if you have to reboot it to use your Headphone, it's very annoying. After all that media hype around it, the Phone looks premium, but does not feel premium when you get one - it's just another enthusiastic Phone on the block. The Phone sometimes freezes and you just hate it when it does; after all that assuring RAM and Memory Management to assure you, the Phone sometimes leaves you cold. The Phone's not worth what 42,000 can get you.

1171,Aj,5,"This phone is a beast specs wise. The colour glacial green is really beauty full . This phone has a very good camera as i was using a one plus 6 before this and i have compared both side by side and this thing out performs it in everything be it screen quality or camera quality , battery life, brightness level, processor , storage is same but rest every thing is better  and the price is absolutely same which is thumbs up.Overall as it's a very nice and features packed phone that will last for atleast 3 to 4 years untill there something drastically new in the market.","This phone is a beast specs wise.

1172,Amazon Customer,5,"Using the phone for almost a month and I Love this phone. I was not planning for a flagship and was searching for phone around 20k. But the features oneplus offered attracted me to oneplus 8. Pro does not feel worth for the extra penny we pay, at least for me. Everyday you spent lot of time with phone (can't help it even if you don't like it üòâ). So the time you spent with this phone, you love each bit of it.Pros :-Display is superb. I don't find much difference in the 90hz refresh rate except battery drain (I don't play games) but with 60 hz itself it's so smooth.-Built quality is great.-Oxygen OS is seamless and no complaints so far.-The phone is very handy, so less chances of slippage.-Nfc is a boon. Using it alot.-5G is a plus but not sure when we can utilize it.-A big salute to the guy who introduced WARP charging. The phone gets fully charged in around 50 - 80mins.Cons :-Battery is not that great. With normal usage on wifi it hardly last for 24 hrs. But with WARP charging no issues.-No good payment apps from oneplus. We have rely on other apps. Will be good to have something similar to Samsung pay.","Using the phone for almost a month and I Love this phone. I was not planning for a flagship and was searching for phone around 20k.

But it clicks fairly good pictures. With SD865 and 90hz display it flies. Better than my OnePlus 7T. For the price it is a very good phone. No lagging or hanging problem.","Good phone with nice display, form factor and light weight. Camera has never been strength of OnePlus or as a matter of fact many Chinese phones.

1182,DILIP CHAITANYA,4,It's 2nd day today. So far so good. 90hz is butter smooth(Me coming from Poco F1) I didn't even change once to 60hz. 6GB model is more than enough for most of the people. But price should be atleast Rs5-7K less. Atleast 120Hz display & IP28 should have been given for this price.,It's 2nd day today.

1185,Ganesh R,5,The OnePlus 8 is a great phone with flagship level features for its price. The 90hz refresh rate make scrolling really smooth and responsive. The slightly curved display gives it a premium lookThe camera is the only thing which sets it back. Outdoor photos look great but indoor photos in low light are like a 20K phone and not a budget flagship.
